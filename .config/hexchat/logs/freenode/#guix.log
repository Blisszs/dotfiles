May 04 15:01:43 <brendyyn>	I've packaged an fcitx input method, but fcitx looks for them in it's own install directory. I'm wondering how we can fix that
May 04 15:02:28 <brendyyn>	it doesn't support any environment variable, nixos seemms to wrap it up with the plugins somehow
May 04 15:04:15 <brendyyn>	civodul: you're relation ship O.o how?
